# first-go
A simple go-lang project explaning the project setup and basic techniques in Go.

This project includes 
-> creating a Go web server.
-> Rendering HTML templates using GO.
-> Creating application level caching.
-> Creating a centralised configuration.
-> experimenting with third party packager like pat and chi for routing purposes.
-> Session management techniques

This App is purely for the purpose of self education and reflection of Go-lang concept using proper implementation techniques.
This shall not be used by any external person as a basis for creating their commercial application and any such case does not bind this repository from being accused into such cases.

This is a good to look reference project.
I will add on more things to it in the near future as I will advance in my journey with Go-lang.
